Hi, I am Vivekanand Rao (but my family, friends & colleagues call me Vivek). After getting a Master’s degree in Computer Science from San Francisco State University (SFSU), I am currently working for Egnyte Inc. as a Sr. Web Developer.  

Prior to pursuing a Master’s Degree in Computer Science, I worked as a Developer & QA Engineer with Aptech Software Ltd. and Lionbridge India. While studying at SFSU, I worked as a Technology Coordinator with California Campus Compact; Technical/Administrative Support Assistant with SFSU’s Information Systems Projects and as a Web Accessibility Evaluator with ACCESS SFSU’s Accessible Technology Initiative. I also interned as a Web Developer with California Department of Financial Institutions.  

I like learning new tools and web technologies and for that I take courses offered by Treehouse, Code School, Envato Tuts+, Learnable , PluralSight and Lynda.com.
